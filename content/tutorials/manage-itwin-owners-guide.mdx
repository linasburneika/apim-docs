## Introduction

<Alert>

This tutorial is for the [Access Control API V2](/apis/access-control-v2/overview/). To control the API version, [see the API versions documentation](/apis/overview/lifecycle/#api-versions).

</Alert>

This tutorial will take you through the process of adding and removing owners for a given iTwin. iTwin owners are the individuals with upmost level of authority on an iTwin; They are implicitly granted all Access Control permissions for the iTwin they own. For more information, see [iTwin owner overview documentation](/apis/access-control/#itwinowner).

By the end of this walk-through, you will be able to utilize the API endpoints in order to add and remove iTwin owners.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you already have:

- A tool, such as `Postman` that can be used to execute HTTP calls. These calls can also be made using the **Try it out** button in the API documentation.
- Already created an iTwin. If you have not, follow the [Create and Query iTwins Guide](/tutorials/create-and-query-itwins-guide/).

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection actions={[<CreateSPAButton clientName="Manage iTwin Owners tutorial"/>]}>

## 1. Register an Application

You will need to register an application to use the iTwin Platform APIs. You can use the **Register** button to automatically create your first single page application (SPA). This will allow you to configure [Authorization Code Flow for your SPA application](/apis/overview/authorization/#authorizesinglepageapplicationsspaanddesktopmobileapplicationsnative) and get the correct access token.

Once generated, you will be shown a few lines of code under the button.

- **IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID** - this is the unique identifier for your application. Displayed on application details page as **Client ID**.
- **IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URI** - specifies where users are redirected after they have chosen whether or not to authenticate your app. Displayed on application details page as one of **Redirect URIs**.
- **IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_LOGOUT_URI** - specifies where users can be returned to after logging out. Displayed on application details page as one of **Post logout redirect URIs**.
- **IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_SCOPES** - list of accesses granted to the application. Displayed on application details page as **Scopes**.

> **Or optionally:** Register and configure your application manually following instructions in [Register and modify an Application](/tutorials/register-and-modify-application/) tutorial.

</TutorialSection>

## 2. Get a token

Before you can make a request to the APIs, a user token is needed. There are several ways to get it.

### Implement Authorization Code Flow in the application

Follow this [article](/apis/overview/authorization/) to implement Authorization code workflow in your application.

<Alert type="informational">

Here you can use Client ID generated from previous registration step.

</Alert>

### Grab a user token from the iTwins documentation page

1. Go [here](/apis/access-control/operations/get-iTwin-roles/)
2. Click **Try it out** button.
3. Under the `Authorization` section, select `authorizationCode` from the dropdown.
4. After the sign in popup closes, the `Authorization` header with token value should be visible beneath the `HTTP request` dropdown.
5. Copy & paste the `Authorization` value for this tutorial.

<Alert type="informational">

Use user token to replace JWT_TOKEN dynamic parameter in the next steps.

## 3. Add a user as an owner

The [Add iTwin Owner](/apis/access-control/operations/add-itwin-owner-member/) endpoint is used to add iTwin owners. The user making this request must be an Owner themself.

The iTwin `id` from an existing iTwin (see [create and query iTwins guide](/tutorials/create-and-query-itwins-guide/)) is required to manage ownership and the `email` of who is being added as the owner, is also required.

The POST call will return the member object. The returned member `id` will be used in subsequent steps to remove the owner.

**Note:** The Account Administrator can also perform this request, and is not required to be an Owner, but that is the only exception to this rule.

    }
  ]

  />
</>
]}>

## 4. Query for an iTwin's owners

The iTwin `id` can be used to [retrieve a list of iTwin owners](/apis/access-control/operations/get-itwin-owner-members/).

The API will return a list of owners for a given iTwin.

</>
]}>

## 5. Remove an owner

The [Remove iTwin Owner](/apis/access-control/operations/remove-itwin-owner-member/) endpoint is used to remove iTwin owners. The user making this request must be an Owner themself.

The iTwin `id` from an existing iTwin (see [create and query iTwins guide](/tutorials/create-and-query-itwins-guide/)) is required to manage ownership and the member `id` of the owner being removed, is also required.

**Note:** The Account Administrator can also perform this request, and is not required to be an Owner, but that is the only exception to this rule.
