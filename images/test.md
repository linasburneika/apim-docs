## Introduction

Attachments and comments provide a great way for your team to discuss and collaborate on solving an issue. Attachments let you provide files with more details about an issue, and comments let multiple people ask questions and talk about an issue without overwriting each others' changes.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Issues REST API to add comments to an already-existing issue and view all of the issue's comments. You will also use the API to attach a file to the issue and then download it.

## Prerequisites

You will need to create an issue in your project so that you can add comments and attachments to it. Please complete the tutorial [Creating Your First Issue](../creating-your-first-issue/) if you haven't already.

Once you have created an issue, note its `id` property. You will need to use that anytime you see **&lt;your-issue-id&gt;** in this tutorial.
