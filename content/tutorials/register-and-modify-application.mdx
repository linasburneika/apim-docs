## Introduction

Before you can start using iTwin Platform REST APIs you need to create an application. Registered application gives you an ability to access iTwin Platform REST APIs and manage client accesses (scopes). This tutorial covers basic application registration and modification steps.

</Introduction>

<TutorialSection>

## 1. Sign in or sign up for a Bentley account

Before you register your first application you need to have a Bentley account to Sign In to iTwin Platform Portal. Only signed-in users can create, view, edit or delete applications.

## 2. Register an application

<Alert type="informational">

To create an application you must Sign in. Only signed-in users can create, view, edit or delete applications.

</Alert>

Before you can start using iTwin Platform REST APIs you need to create an application. Registered application gives you an ability to access iTwin Platform REST APIs and manage client accesses (scopes).

To register an application follow these instructions:

1. Go to the **[My Apps](/my-apps)** page
1. Click the **+ Register New** to open new application registration form
1. Give your application a **Name**
1. Select **API associations** you are going to use
   - API association represents set of APIs. Full list of API associations with their APIs you can find on [iTwin Platform Documentation](/apis) page.
   - Each API endpoint requires certain OAuth scopes. When you select API associations that your application will use, registration form will allow you to chose scopes that are available in these associations.
1. Change the scope list to give your application appropriate accesses
   - Make sure you selected correct API associations. You will see only a set of scopes from selected API associations.
1. Select your **Application type** (SPA, Web App, Service or Desktop/Mobile)

   - **Single Page Application (SPA)** is a web application that runs in a browser and does not require the page to be reloaded.
   - **Web App** is a traditional web application where every change involves a new request for the server to provide an HTML page.
   - **Service** represents an automated service with no human interaction.
   - **Desktop/Mobile** is an application that runs on a desktop computer or mobile device.

     <Alert type="informational">

     Make sure you choose valid Application type. You won't be able to change it later.

     </Alert>

1. Enter **Redirect URIs**
   - **Redirect URI** specifies the location where the authorization server can send the user once the application has been successfully authorized.
   - If you create your application to complete some other tutorial, you can use `http://localhost:3000/signin-callback` as a **Redirect URI**.
1. Enter **Post logout redirect URIs** (Optional)
   - **Post logout redirect URI** specifies the location where the authorization server can send the user after a logout.
   - If you create your application to complete some other tutorial, you can leave **Post logout redirect URIs** empty.
1. Please review and acknowledge the [Terms of Service](https://connect-agreementportal.bentley.com/AgreementApp/Home/Eula/view/readonly/BentleyConnect). By proceeding to register your application, you agree to our [Terms of Service](https://connect-agreementportal.bentley.com/AgreementApp/Home/Eula/view/readonly/BentleyConnect)
1. Click **Save** to submit application creation

<Alert type="informational">

After registering a **Service** or **Web App** application, you will see the success dialog with your **Client Secret**. Make sure you copy and save it. We don't store it
and you will not be able to see it again.
