## Introduction

The goal of this tutorial is to specify calibration settings to _Reality Modeling_, so that you can obtain a better model.

In this tutorial, we will cover how to send calibration settings to _Reality Modeling_, and how to retrieve calibration reports from the service.

</Introduction>

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you already have:

- Completed the [Reality Modeling Quick Start tutorial](/tutorials/contextcapture-api-quick-start).
- A basic understanding of the calibration/aerotriangulation concept in Reality Modeling. See [Reality Modeling Master Help](https://docs.bentley.com/LiveContent/web/ContextCapture%20Help-v10/en/GUID-95336991-F284-4AD8-A33B-9AE341507D5C.html) for a description of the calibration settings

## 1. Specifying calibration settings

If you want to apply specific settings for the calibration, you can add a file in the workspace reality data: the file `at_settings.json` has to be uploaded to `/{jobId}/data/`.
Note that no check on the uploaded file is performed until the job is actually submitted, and if the parameters are not fitted to the inputs, the job will failed.

Note that every properties in the following structure are optional.
Strings separated by `-` mean only one option can be specified. Strings separated by `|` can be combined using `|`, eg: `"QR Codes|Chili Tags"`. For parameter `"AdjustWithinTolerance %.%"`, `%.%` has to be replace by a double.

If you have a preset and you want to apply it, upload it as `at_preset.cfg` in `/{jobId}/data/`. No need to specify the name in the the ATSettings file.

## 2. Accessing calibration results

Once the step _AT_CloudExport_ is executed, you can access calibration results (including reports) through the workspace reality data.

In `/{jobId}/outputs/calibration/` you will find:

- `acquisition_report`, a folder containing an HTML page with CSS regarding the acquisition of your images
- `quality_report`, a folder containing HTML pages regarding with quality of your calibration
- `block.xmlz` and `block - TiePoints.xmlz`, the corresponding _CCOrientations_ of this calibration

## Continue learning

Congratulations for completing the _Reality Modeling_ calibration tutorial!
You should now be able to specify calibration settings and retrieve reports once a calibration is completed.

To go further and use _Reality Modeling_ to its maximum potential, you can check the following tutorials.
