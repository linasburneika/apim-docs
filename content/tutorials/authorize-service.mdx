## Introduction

When building a server-side app that securely stores secrets, use the following procedures to set up your authorization. This tutorial is based on the OAuth workflow, diagram, and steps described in the [service app authorization documentation](/apis/overview/authorization/service-app/).

## Register your application

The first step for authorizing your service app is to register your application.

1. If you have not created an application, open the [My Apps](/my-apps) page under your **Profile** menu, and click the **Register New** button. In this case, the application type is **Service**.
2. Make sure to save the `client_id` and the `client_secret` supplied when you create your application.

**IMPORTANT**

Keep your client credentials, i.e., **client ID**, **client secret**, and **access tokens**, secure. Do not include them in publicly accessible code where they could be discovered. Instead, store them safely on a backend server.

</Alert>

<Alert>

**Note**

Service apps need permission to access the your iTwins or iTwin-related data. You can set up iTwin roles and permissions using the [Access Control API](/apis/access-control/) and the generated email on the _App Details_ page in **My Apps > App Name**. Setting up access control is not required for this tutorial; however, it must be set up before your application makes iTwin specific API requests.

</Alert>

## Obtain an access token

Once you have your app registered, you can obtain an access token by following these steps:

1. Send a request to the authorization server endpoint.

   <RequestLine
     method="POST"
     baseUrl={(data) => data.authority}
     path="/connect/token"
   />

Below is an example request along with required parameters. You can obtain the _client_id_ and _redirect_uri_ from your app registration on [My Apps](/my-apps). If you didnâ€™t save your _client_secret_, generate a new one from the same app registration.

<ExecutableCodeBlock
  method="POST"
  baseUrl={(data) => data.authority}
  path="/connect/token"
  headers={{
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
  }}
  body={new URLSearchParams(
    'client_id=<client_id>&client_secret=<client_secret>&scope=itwin-platform&grant_type=client_credentials'
  ).toString()}
  dataToSave={[
    {
      variableName: 'accessToken',
      jsonQuery: 'access_token',
    },
  ]}
/>

2. Your application can now use the access token returned by the token endpoint to access APIs.

## Use your token

If you received a `200 OK` response to your token request, you have successfully obtained a token. You can use this token to call various iTwin Platform APIs. You can try making an API call to `users/me` endpoint to test your token. On success, this request returns the profile information for the user account associated with the token received.

Remember, the iTwin Platform Base URI is `api.bentley.com`.

<ExecutableCodeBlock
  method="GET"
  path="/users/me"
  headers={(data) => ({
    Accept: 'application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json',
    Authorization: `Bearer ${
      data.accessToken ?? '<returned token from the previous request>'
    }`,
  })}
/>

## Client

If you're developing a service application and need to handle service authentication, you can utilize a TypeScript client specifically designed for this workflow. This client is available in the [iTwin auth-clients](https://github.com/iTwin/auth-clients/tree/main/packages/service/README.md) repository and can be easily integrated into your project via the npm package [@itwin/service-authorization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itwin/service-authorization).
