## Introduction

When developing Single Page Applications (SPA), we use a client-side framework and the following procedures to set up authorization. This tutorial is based on the OAuth workflow, diagram, and steps described in the [Native/SPA authorization documentation](/apis/overview/authorization/native-spa/).

## Register your application

The first step for authorizing your SPA is to register your application.

1. If you have not created an application, open the [My Apps](/my-apps) page under your **Profile** menu and click the **Register New** button. In this case, the application type is **SPA**.
2. For this tutorial, add the redirect URI, `https://developer.bentley.com/redirect-tutorial`, during app registration, or on the _App Details_ for a previously registered application. If you are testing locally or on a deployed app, you will use the redirect URI of your application.
3. You also need the `client_id` of your application. You can copy the `client_id` from the App page by clicking the **Copy** button below the title.

## Obtain an access token

Once you have your app registered, you can obtain an access token by following these steps:

1. Generate _code_verifier_ and _code_challenge_.

<GeneratePkceButton />
<SimpleCodeBlockUsingTutorialData
  text={(data) => (data.pkce ? JSON.stringify(data.pkce, undefined, 2) : null)}
  visible={(data) => data.pkce}
/>

2. When the user opens the SPA, redirect them to the authorization server endpoint.

<RequestLine baseUrl={(data) => data.authority} path="/connect/authorize" />

Below is an example request along with required parameters.

You can obtain the _client_id_ and _redirect_uri_ from your app registration on [My Apps](/my-apps). You can copy the _code_challenge_ generated above, but note that production code must generate a new _code_challenge_ for each request and never reuse the same value.

<NavigateToAuthorizationServer
  query={new URLSearchParams(
    `response_type=code&client_id=<client_id>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>&scope=itwin-platform&code_challenge=<code_challenge>&code_challenge_method=S256`
  ).toString()}
/>

3. Allow user to login and give consent to the application for calling APIs on their behalf.

4. Once authenticated, extract the `code` in the response from the `redirect_uri` that authorization server is configured to use.

   <RequestLine
     baseUrl={(data) => {
       return `${
         data.code && data.redirectURI
           ? `${data.redirectURI}?code=${data.code}`
           : 'https://example-rediect-uri?code=<code>'
       }`;
     }}
     visible={(data) => {
       return data.code ? true : false;
     }}
   />

   <Alert>

   **Note**

   Authorization codes are time-sensitive. If your code expires, send a new request to the authorization server for a new code.

   </Alert>

5. Send a request to the token endpoint to exchange the authorization code for an access token.

   <RequestLine
     method="POST"
     baseUrl={(data) => data.authority}
     path="/connect/token"
   />

<ExecutableCodeBlock
  method="POST"
  baseUrl={(data) => data.authority}
  path="/connect/token"
  headers={{
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
  }}
  body={(data) =>
    new URLSearchParams(
      `client_id=${
        data.clientId ?? '<client_id>'
      }&grant_type=authorization_code&code_verifier=${
        data.pkce ? data.pkce.code_verifier : '<code_verifier>'
      }&code=${data.code ?? '<code>'}&redirect_uri=${
        data.redirectURI ?? '<redirect_uri>'
      }`
    ).toString()
  }
  dataToSave={[
    {
      variableName: 'accessToken',
      jsonQuery: 'access_token',
    },
  ]}
/>

6. Your application can now use the access token returned by the token endpoint to access APIs on behalf of the user.

## Refresh token

Unlike [native](/tutorials/authorize-native) and [web apps](/tutorials/authorize-webapp), SPAs don't require a refresh token when the access token expires. This is because they can renew a session that is about to expire using a background silent sign-in.

## Use your token

If you received a `200 OK` response to your token request, you have successfully obtained a token. You can use this token to call various iTwin Platform APIs. You can try making an API call to `users/me` endpoint to test your token. On success, this request returns the profile information for the user account associated with the token received.

Remember, the iTwin Platform Base URI is `api.bentley.com`.

<ExecutableCodeBlock
  method="GET"
  path="/users/me"
  headers={(data) => ({
    Accept: 'application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json',
    Authorization: `Bearer ${
      data.accessToken ?? '<returned token from the previous request>'
    }`,
  })}
/>

## Client

If you're developing a SPA and need to handle user authentication in a browser environment, you can utilize a TypeScript client specifically designed for this workflow. This client is available in the [iTwin auth-clients](https://github.com/iTwin/auth-clients/tree/main/packages/browser/README.md) repository and can be easily integrated into your project via the npm package [@itwin/browser-authorization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itwin/browser-authorization).
