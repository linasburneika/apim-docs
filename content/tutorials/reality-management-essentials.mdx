## Introduction

This tutorial covers the _essential_ topics for using the [Reality Management API](/apis/reality-management/overview).
You will learn the following:

- How to create a reality data.
- How to upload data files to your reality data.
- How to query your created reality data.

You will also see how your reality data looks in an iTwin Viewer application.

<Alert>

**Use sample data**

This tutorial walks you through using the Reality Management API. We recommend using sample names and data while learning the API for this tutorial. The same instructions apply when using the Reality Management API for your production applications.

</Alert>

## Before you begin

Ensure you meet the following requirements before starting the tutorial:

- Be familiar with the concept of an iTwin. See the [iTwin API Overview](/apis/itwins/overview/) for more information.
- Be familiar with the concept of Reality Data. See the [Reality Management API Overview](/apis/reality-management/overview/) for more information.
- (Optional) Be familiar with [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview).
  You can complete this tutorial regardless of your Azure knowledge level.
- (Optional) An API client tool that allows you to execute HTTP calls.
  For ease of use, we have added executable code blocks enabling you to make sample requests within the tutorial.
  API client tools are helpful when testing your real-world applications.

## Create a reality data

The Reality Management API enables you to create and manage reality models and data.
A _reality model_ is the real world environment visualized in a reality data viewer and is stored as data files.
_Reality data_ is a place to store your reality model and any information describing that reality model.

Send a request to the create reality data endpoint:

<RequestLine
  method="POST"
  path="/reality-management/reality-data/"
  href="/apis/reality-management/operations/create-reality-data/"
/>

The example request includes the following properties in its body:

| **Parameter** | **Required** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The ID of your reality data is automatically populated in the following requests that need it.

## Upload your reality model to the reality data's container

A reality data provides basic information about your reality model through its properties (such as what is the type/format of the files, where is the root document, etc).
When you created your reality data, a container in the cloud was also created to serve as a home for your reality model.

This section details how to access and upload reality data files to that container.

<Section level={2}>

### Get your reality data's container

The Reality Management API exposes two endpoints you can use to access your reality data's container.
One endpoint provides read access to the container. The other endpoint provides write access.
However, both endpoints accept the same parameters.
The container is hosted in [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/).

We want write access so you can upload the reality data files to the container.
For more information on read access, please see the [Retrieve read access to reality data container](/apis/reality-management/operations/get-read-access-to-reality-data-container) reference.

For write access, send the request to the write access endpoint.

<RequestLine
  method="GET"
  path="/reality-management/reality-data/{id}/writeaccess?iTwinId={iTwinId}"
  href="/apis/reality-management/operations/get-write-access-to-reality-data-container/"
/>

The endpoint accepts the following parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Required** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id            | Yes          | The ID of your reality data. **Reminder:** The ID is pre-populated in this tutorial if you completed the [Create reality data request example](#create-reality-data-request-example).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| iTwinId       | No           | The ID of your iTwin. It affects the permissions for accessing the container as discussed in the [Retrieve write access to reality data container](/apis/reality-management/operations/get-write-access-to-reality-data-container/) reference. **Reminder:** The ID is pre-populated in this tutorial if you clicked the [**Create an iTwin**](#create-an-itwin) button during setup. |

  }}
/>

The `href` returned in the response is a SAS URI with write access to the Azure blob hosting your reality data's container.

<Alert>

**Understanding the SAS URI**

Understanding the SAS URI is not required to use it for the API or tutorial.
You can learn more about Azure Storage SAS URI's from [Microsoft's SAS token documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#sas-token).

</Alert>

</Section>

<Section level={2}>

### Upload your files to the container

Microsoft has several workflows available for uploading data to an Azure blob.
Exhaustively exploring these options is beyond this scope of this tutorial.
However, we will point you to a couple of workflows that will allow you to upload the previously downloaded `Scene` folder with as little friction as possible.

<Section level={3}>

#### Uploading the files via the command line

[AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10) is a command line tool that you can use to upload files to your storage account.
This is our recommended way to upload your files for the tutorial.

To upload your reality data files, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have clicked the [**Download Data**](#get-your-data-files) button and unzipped the downloaded `Scene` folder.
2. [Download AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10#download-azcopy).
3. [Run AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10#run-azcopy) via the command line.
   `azcopy copy "{path_to_downloaded_Scene_folder}" "{SAS_URI_from_the_previous_response}" --recursive`

Microsoft has an example in the [Use a SAS token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10#option-2-use-a-sas-token) section of their [Get started with AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10) page.
Be sure to at least read the [Run AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10#run-azcopy) link. It points out restrictions on where you can run AzCopy.

</Section>

<Section level={3}>

#### Uploading the files graphically

Microsoft has a desktop application called Azure Storage Explorer that you can download to have a
graphical experience of dragging and dropping your reality data files into your blob container.

To upload your reality data files using Azure Storage Explorer, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have clicked the [**Download Data**](#get-your-data-files) button and unzipped the downloaded `Scene` folder.
2. Download the application by going to Microsoft's [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/) website and selecting your operating system.
3. Once you have the application downloaded and open, you can follow Microsoft's instructions in the
   [Attach to an individual resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows#attach-to-an-individual-resource)
   and [Shared access signature (SAS) URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows#shared-access-signature-sas-url)
   sections of their [Get started with Storage Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows) page.
   The resource you want to connect to should be "Blob container" (or something similarly named).
4. After following Microsoft's instructions and connecting, drag and drop the
   `Scene` folder into the container.

</Section>

<Alert>

**Programmatic options**

The above two options are easiest for uploading your reality model quickly.
However, if you are attempting to programmatically upload a reality model in your application, we recommend using Microsoft's Azure Blob Storage client libraries. Microsoft has Azure Blob Storage client libraries for [.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet?tabs=visual-studio%2Cmanaged-identity%2Croles-azure-portal%2Csign-in-azure-cli%2Cidentity-visual-studio), [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-java?tabs=powershell%2Cmanaged-identity%2Croles-azure-portal%2Csign-in-azure-cli), [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python?tabs=managed-identity%2Croles-azure-portal%2Csign-in-azure-cli), [JavaScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/quickstart-blobs-javascript-browser), [C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/quickstart-blobs-c-plus-plus?tabs=environment-variable-windows), and [Go](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-go?tabs=roles-azure-portal).
If you are using a language that does not have a client library, check out the raw [Azure Blob Storage REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api).

## Query your created reality data

The Reality Management API exposes two endpoints you can use to query your reality data.

<Section level={2}>

### Query reality data associated with an iTwin

This endpoint returns the first 100 reality data associated with the iTwin specified in the request.
It only returns reality data that you have access to, relative to your organization's access rights.

To query all reality data associated with your iTwin, send a request to the get iTwin's reality data endpoint.

<RequestLine
  method="GET"
  path="/reality-management/reality-data/?iTwinId={iTwinId}"
  href="/apis/reality-management/operations/get-all-reality-data/"
/>

The example request includes the following parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Required** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| iTwinId       | No           | The ID of your iTwin. If you do not provide your iTwin ID, then the request instead returns the first 100 reality data that you have access to across all iTwins. **Reminder:** The ID is pre-populated in this tutorial if you clicked the [**Create an iTwin**](#create-an-itwin) button during setup. |

## Visualize your newly uploaded reality data

After creating a reality data and uploading your reality model to its container, you can now visualize your reality data in an [iTwin Viewer](/tutorials/web-application-quick-start/).

Click **View Reality Data** to see the reality model you created in a Viewer.

<LinkButtonUsingTutorialData
  href={(data) => {
    return `/my-itwins/${data.iTwinId ? data.iTwinId : 'iTwinId'}/${
      data.realityDataId ? data.realityDataId : 'realityDataId'
    }/reality-data-tutorial-viewer/`;
  }}
  handleTutorialStateValidation={(data, helpers) => {
    let isValid = true;
    if (!data.realityDataId) {
      isValid = false;
      helpers?.toaster.negative(
        <span>
          Did you complete the <b>Create a reality data</b> step?
        </span>,
        {

**Viewer Errors**

The reality data viewer will attempt to display helpful error messages if it detects a potential mistake.
To resolve some of the errors, please check the following:

1. Ensure that you have completed all steps of the tutorial _before_ clicking the **View Reality Data** button.
2. Verify that the `rootDocument` path specified during the [Create a reality data](#create-a-reality-data) step is still valid based on the structure of the files you uploaded during the [Upload your reality model to the reality data's container](#upload-your-reality-model-to-the-reality-datas-container) step.

</Alert>

The official [Reality Data sample](https://www.itwinjs.org/sandboxes/iTwinPlatform/Reality%20Data) provides an example on attaching and visualizing reality data in an iTwin Viewer.
Check out that sample, our [iTwin.js documentation](https://www.itwinjs.org/reference/core-frontend/views/displaystylestate/attachrealitymodel/), the [@itwin/reality-data-client package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itwin/reality-data-client), and the [reality-capture web application](https://github.com/iTwin/reality-capture/tree/main/typescript/examples/web-app) for how to visualize your reality data in your own application.
