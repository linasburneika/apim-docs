## Introduction

The Reporting API is a tool for aggregating digital twin data from multiple sources
into one unified format and place. With the Reporting API, consuming your data through
business intelligence applications such as Power BI or your own custom-built
application is dramatically simplified.

This tutorial will cover all the fundamental steps to a typical workflow of creating
an Insights Report using iModel data. We will first go through a step by step guide
on how to use the Reporting APIs to configure and generate a simple Report. We will also
briefly cover a small sample NodeJS application that goes through the same steps to help
you get started writing an application of your own to build Reports on your own iModels.

</Introduction>

<TutorialSection actions={[<CreateSPAButton clientName="Creating an insights report using imodel data tutorial"/>]}>

## 1. Set up your environment

This tutorial expects that you have access to a registered application and have access to a project as owner/administrator or know someone who has owner/admin privileges. You can use the **Register** button to automatically create your first single page application (SPA). This will allow you to configure [Authorization Code Flow for your SPA application](/apis/overview/authorization/#authorize-single-page-applications-spa-and-desktopmobile-applications-native) and get the correct access token.

Once generated, you will be shown a few lines of code under the button.

- **IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID** - this is the unique identifier for your application. Displayed on application details page as **Client ID**.
- **IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URI** - specifies where users are redirected after they have chosen whether or not to authenticate your app. Displayed on application details page as one of **Redirect URIs**. Displayed on application details page as one of **Redirect URIs**.
- **IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_LOGOUT_URI** - specifies where users can be returned to after logging out. Displayed on application details page as one of **Post logout redirect URIs**.
- **IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_SCOPES** - list of accesses granted to the application. Displayed on application details page as **Scopes**. Displayed on application details page as **Scopes**.

> **Or optionally:** Register and configure your application manually following instructions in [Register and modify an Application](/tutorials/register-and-modify-application/) tutorial.

Use of the Reporting APIs requires some iModel/Project level Permissions.
For these Permissions, you must be an Organization Administrator for the Organization
that owns a given Project or have `administration_manage_roles` Permission assigned at
the Project level. If you do not have admin access to the Project or iModel you would
like to use, contact somebody who is a Project Administrator. As a Project Administrator,
you can use APIs described in the [Manage Project Team Members](/tutorials/manage-user-members-on-itwins-guide/)
tutorial to create a Role and update it with `"permissions": ["REPORTINGVIEW", "REPORTINGEDIT", "imodels_read", "imodels_write"]`.
Once this is done and the Role is assigned to you, you can use any iModel inside your
Project to finish this tutorial.

## 2. Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Report through the Reporting APIs

Before diving into the code to create an Insights Report based on iModel data, let's take
some time to understand the workflow and the API calls that are involved.

### Workflow for iModel Reports

- Create a new Report.
- Create an empty iModel Mapping.
- Assign the Mapping created to the new Report (create a report mapping).
- Create one or more Groups under that Mapping.
- Create one or more GroupProperties for each Group.
- Extract your data from the iModel.
- Ensure your Extraction has completed.

</TutorialSection>

### 2.1 Create a Report

In this section, we will introduce what a report is and how to create a report using our API.

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection subSection={true}>

#### 2.1.1 What is a Report?

A Report represents a collection of data. The way the Reporting API views a Report is as a
collection of Mappings. With the Reporting API, you will assign one or more Mappings to a
Report to be consumed by some application such as Power BI as a single data source.

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection
  subSection={true}
  actions={[
    <Title>Example HTTP Request to Create Report</Title>,
    <CodeBlock language="http" code={`POST https://api.bentley.com/insights/reporting/reports/ HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "displayName": "myReport",
    "description": "myReportDescription",
    "projectId": "myProjectId"
}`}/>,
    <Title>Example result from the Create Report Operation</Title>,
    <CodeBlock language="json"
      code={`{
  "report":{
    "id":"myReportId",
    "displayName":"myReport",
    "description":"myReportDescription",
    "deleted":false,
    "_links":{
      "project":{
        "href":"https://api.bentley.com/projects/myProjectId"
      }
    }
  }
}`} />,
]}>

#### 2.1.2 How do I create a Report using the Reporting API?

First of all, you need a Bearer Token to run all the APIs in this tutorial. In order to do
so, go to our [documentation](/apis/insights/operations/create-report/),
click on `Try it out` button. Under **Authorization**, select `authorizationCode` of second
dropdown button and wait for the token to be generated.

For this API request, you need to specify your report name, description and projectId in the
request body. See the sample for details.

You can also execute the request directly at the [Create Report API documentation](/apis/insights/operations/create-report/)
page using the 'Try It' button.

Take note of the `id` in the response. This will be used later as `reportId`.

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection subSection={true}>

### 2.2 Create a Mapping

In this section, we will introduce what a mapping is and how to create a mapping using our API.

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection subSection={true}>

#### 2.2.1 What is a Mapping?

The Reporting story begins with Mapping. Mapping is a configuration process where all desired
data sources are identified. These Mappings also will help describe what data is desired
from each data source and how to structure it for Insights. The Mapping process will be unique
for each type of data source. For example, a Mapping for data from an iModel may not look the
same as a Mapping for data from Validation, but ultimately all that data needs to arrive at
one place and that is what Mapping orchestrates for you.

<TutorialSection
  subSection={true}
  actions={[
    <Title>Example HTTP Request to Create Mapping</Title>,
    <CodeBlock language="http" code={`POST https://api.bentley.com/insights/reporting/datasources/iModels/myIModelId/mappings HTTP/1.1

}`}/>,
    <Title>Example result from the Create Report Operation</Title>,
    <CodeBlock language="json"
      code={`{

      "imodel":{
        "href":"https://api.bentley.com/imodels/myIModelId"
    }
  }
}`} />,
]}>

#### 2.2.2 How do I create a Mapping using the Reporting API?

Creating a Mapping is simple. All you need to provide is a `displayName` and a `description`.
See the sample for details.

You can also execute the request directly at the [Create Mapping API documentation](/apis/insights/operations/create-mapping/)
page using the 'Try It' button.

Take note of the `id` in the response. This will be used later as `mappingId`.

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection subSection={true}>

### 2.3 Link your Mapping to your Report

In this section, we will introduce what a report mapping is and how to create a report mapping
using our API.

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection subSection={true}>

#### 2.3.1 What is a Report Mapping?

Report Mappings are used to assign a Mapping to a Report. This relationship is many-to-many.
One report can have many mappings, and one mapping can be assigned to many reports. When generating
the Report data, our API will find all the Mappings assigned to this Report and collect data from
each data source defined by the Mappings.

### 2.4 Create a Group

In this section, we will introduce what a group is and how to create a group using our API.

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection subSection={true}>

#### 2.4.1 What is a Group?

A Group is a collection of data defined by a given query or other constraints. In this tutorial,
you can consider a Group as a collection of iModel elements.

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection
  subSection={true}
  actions={[
    <Title>Example HTTP Request to Create Group</Title>,
    <CodeBlock language="http" code={`POST https://api.bentley.com/insights/reporting/datasources/iModels/myIModelId/mappings/myMappingId/groups HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "displayName":"myGroupName",
  "description":"myGroupDescription",
  "query": "SELECT * FROM BisCore.PhysicalElement"
}`}/>,
    <Title>Example result from the Create Group Operation</Title>,
    <CodeBlock language="json"
      code={`{
  "group":{
    "id": "myGroupId",
    "displayName":"myGroupName",

    "query": "SELECT * FROM BisCore.PhysicalElement",
    "_links": {
      "imodel": {
        "href": "https://api.bentley.com/imodels/myIModelId"
      },
      "mapping": {
        "href": "https://api.bentley.com/insights/reporting/datasources/iModels/myIModelId/mappings/myMappingId"
      }
    }
}`} />,
  ]}>

#### 2.4.2 How do I create a Group using the Reporting API?

The `query` needs to be a valid [ECSQL](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/ecsql/) query that will
be executed against the target iModel to build this group. If you are unfamiliar with ECSQL, a
great starter query to get you through this tutorial is `SELECT * FROM bis.physicalelement`. You
can use the [iModel Console](https://imodelconsole.bentley.com) to explore your iModel in detail
using ECSQL.

You can also execute the request directly at the [Create Group API documentation](/apis/insights/operations/create-group/)
page using the 'Try It' button.

Take note of the `id` in the response. This will be used later as `groupId`.

### 2.5 Create a GroupProperty

In this section, we will introduce what a GroupProperty is and how to create a GroupProperty
using our API.

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection subSection={true}>

#### 2.5.1 What is a GroupProperty?

A GroupProperty is a property to be extracted from the iModel elements and how it should be
identified in your Report.

      "group": {
        "href": "https://api.bentley.com/insights/reporting/datasources/imodels/myIModelId/mappings/myMappingId/groups/myGroupId"
      }
    }
  }
}`} />,
  ]}>

#### 2.5.2 How do I create a GroupProperty using the Reporting API?

You need to define one or multiple properties you want to extract from the each row of data
returned by the `query` defined in your Group - each row is an element in the iModel. There
are some restrictions on the property parameters:

- dataType options: `"Boolean"`, `"Number"`, `"String"`
- quantityType options: `"Undefined"`, `"Area"`, `"Distance"`, `"Force"`, `"Mass"`, `"Monetary"`, `"Time"`, `"Volume"`
- ecPropertyType is a dataType
- ECProperties are specific to each iModel so check on the iModel before defining them.

Again a great resource to help you understand this configuration and what properties to select
is the [iModel Console](https://imodelconsole.bentley.com). Navigate to your target iModel and
enter the `query` you defined earlier when creating a Group. This will provide you with the
information you need to fill the fields like `ecSchemaName`, `ecClassName`, `ecPropertyName`,
etc. If you aren't able to find any meaningful properties to map for your iModel elements,
`Yaw`, `Pitch`, and `Roll` are always a safe bet when it comes to 3D geometric elements.

You can also execute the request directly at the [Create GroupProperty API documentation](/apis/insights/operations/create-groupproperty/)
page using the 'Try It' button.

### 2.6 Run a Data Extraction

In this section, we will introduce what a data extraction is and how to create a data extraction and check extraction status using our API.

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection subSection={true}>

#### 2.6.1 What is a data Extraction?

More often than not, some preprocessing will be required before the data defined in a Mapping
is actually available to be consumed as a Report. Endpoints are provided in the Reporting API
to trigger the data Extraction process. Depending on the data source this may be a one-time
action, required for data syncs, or not required at all. See data source specific
[documentation](/apis/insights/overview) to find out more.

For iModels as a data source, data Extraction is a background process that runs the queries
defined by each Group in each Mapping to extract iModel elements and the specified properties.
Each data Extraction will run all the Mappings linked to all Reports associated with an iModel.

</TutorialSection>

<TutorialSection
  subSection={true}
  actions={[
    <Title>Example HTTP Request to run a data extraction</Title>,
