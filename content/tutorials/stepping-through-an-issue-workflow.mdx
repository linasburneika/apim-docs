## Introduction

Each issue type by default is associated with a workflow. Workflows help users keep track of which of their issues they have addressed and how far along they are with each.

In this tutorial you will learn how to look up the workflow for the issue you created and then step the issue through the workflow's statuses until it is considered closed (i.e., done).

## Prerequisites

You will need to first complete the tutorial [Creating Your First Issue](../creating-your-first-issue/) so that you have an issue to modify.

Take note of the issue's `type` and `id` properties, as you will need them here.

## 1. Look Up the Workflow

Make a GET request to the [Get Workflow](/apis/issues-v1/operations/get-workflow/) endpoint to retrieve the workflow definition.

#### URL

The URL of the request includes a path of `/workflows` followed by your issue type. You must also provide **projectId** as a query string parameter.

Format: `https://api.bentley.com/issues/workflows/<type>?projectId=<projectId>`

#### Understanding the Workflow Definition

The workflow definition in the response body consists of two main concepts: **states** and **transitions**. States are named statuses that an issue can have as the value of its `status` property. Transitions dictate the possible changes between states; if an issue is in Status A, then it can be changed to Status B if and only if there is a transition with a `start` of A and an `end` of B.

Thus, a workflow can be pictured as a flowchart where states are bubbles and transitions are arrows. Below is a visual representation of the workflow shown in the sample response body.

![Visualized Workflow](/images/issue-workflow.png)

Examine the sample response and note that one of the states in the list of states has a `name` of "Open". Also, there are transitions named "Assign" and "Void" that both have a `start` of "Open", and have `end` values of "Assigned" and "Voided", respectively. Thus, an issue with a `status` of "Open" can be changed to have a `status` of "Assigned" or "Voided", but no other values.

<Alert type="informational">

Tip for application designers: Usually, a UI element for setting an issue's workflow status consists of a dropdown list. Each transition that's available for the current status (i.e., has the current status as its `start`) appears as an option in the list with text equal to the transition's `displayName`. Selecting the option modifies the issue's status to the value of `end` for that transition.

## 2. Update the Issue's Status

An issue's **status** property dictates what step of the workflow it's currently on. When you create an issue, you can set its **status** to one of the strings listed in the **startStates** array. Since you didn't set a status when creating your issue in the **Creating Your First Issue** tutorial, it was automatically set to the first `startState`, "Open".

To change the issue's status, make a PATCH request to the [Update Issue](/apis/issues-v1/operations/modify-issue/) endpoint, just as you did in the **Creating Your First Issue** tutorial. Include the **status** property, making sure to set its value according to the workflow transitions.

For instance, to change your issue from "Open" to "Assigned", make a request with the body shown in "Sample Body (1)".

To keep stepping the issue through the workflow, make additional Update Issue requests, using "Sample Body (2)" and then "Sample Body (3)". This will change the issue from "Assigned" to "Review" and then "Approved". Once all of these requests are done, you should get the response shown under "Sample response".

Note that the "Approved" status in the workflow definition has a **stateCategory** of "Closed" rather than "Open". `stateCategory` is a conceptual grouping of workflow states into one of three types: "Open", "Closed", and "Draft". Conceptually, to users, an issue in an Open state generally requires attention; one in Closed has been taken care of (or deemed not a problem). A Draft issue is being worked on by its creator and may not be ready for review by others yet. In terms of functionality, Open and Draft issues can both be edited like normal, but a Closed issue cannot be edited except to change its **status**.

<Alert>

Note: The **state** property of an issue (not to be confused with **status**) corresponds to the **stateCategory** of the issue's current **status** in the workflow definition. The **state** property is set automatically and cannot be included in the body of **Create Issue** or **Update Issue** requests.

</Alert>

Well done! You now understand how to use the Issues REST API to find an issue's workflow, how the workflow affects updating the issue (the **status** property), and how the issue becomes _open_ or _closed_ as a result.
